# kubernetes-cli-console-study-2021

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) 2020 survey, Kubernetes use in production has increased to 83%, up from 78% in 2019. However, this and other relevant surveys neither report on the types of Kubernetes tools that developers prefer, nor the types of tasks these tools would aid. We present a two-part study to address this research gap. For the first part of the study, we conducted a generative survey with X respondents formulated as a 3x3 matrix that asked which types of tool modalities (CLI, Graphical Console, or IDE) are preferred to aid which types of Kubernetes tasks (CRUD, debugging, and monitoring). 

For the second part of the study, we conducted a within-subjects, remotely moderated user study with X participants that performed a Kubernetes task using the kubectl CLI and the OpenShift web console. We measured and compared costs of exhaustion and disruption from completing the Kubernetes task using both tool interfaces by counting user input frequencies (executed commands, clicks, and mouse movements) and user input switching frequencies (e.g. from mouse to keyboard), respectively. In support of our survey, we found that more experienced developers, with the exception of Kubernetes monitoring tasks, prefer to use CLIs over consoles due to associated costs of exhaustion and disruption. We share participant recommendations for improving each tool interface and our own design insights observed from the study to inform the future design of Kubernetes tool interfaces.
